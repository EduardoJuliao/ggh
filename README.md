## Available commands

### pull

When pulling from Repo, `ggh pull` will run the sequence of commands:

1. git pull
2. gulp js:app
3. gulp css:build

## Installing

To install this package locally there's two options:

```powershell
tsc; npm install -g
```

## BTW

It's a complete mess and needs improvements
